                    Pickleballs are a necessity in being order to play a game. Make sure that
                    you have many pickleballs, so you don't have to chase them if you hit it away.
                    It is also good to have multiple balls incase one cracks.

                    A standard pickleball court happens to be around the same size as a doubles badminton court and 
                    the court measures 44 feet long (inclusive of lines) and 20 feet wide (inclusive of lines). 
                    The net height of a pickleball court is 36 inches high at the sidelines and 34 inches high in the middle.
                    The kitchen is spans 7 feet from the net on both sides.
